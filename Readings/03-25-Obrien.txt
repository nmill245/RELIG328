*What is the reading about?
	This reading is an introduction to the book as well as an introduction to modern Indigenous theories and practices. It details main ideas of "Gratitude and Reciprocity", "Everything is Alive, Everything is Connected", and "Indigenous Pedagogy: Learning in Place". These ideals help show ways in which Indigenous thought differs from settler thought, as well as outlining tenets. The chapter does note that there is a variety of belief systems, dialects, ideas, and more and as such generating just one belief system will not work, but it can be a starting point.

	The author uses primary sources from Native Peoples' as well as other secondary sources to generate his claims and support them. He also uses his own experience and ethos to build the arguments.

*What are 2+ key terms & their definitions?
	Settler Colonialism - The act of which settlers (not natives) attempt to dismiss, assimilate, and erase native culture

What is a good discussion question for this reading?
	How should we react to and interact with secrecy in religion / religious ideas?

How does some element from this chapter connect with a previous reading/discussion?

There is a large intrigue by people to learn more of Indigenous beliefs and practices from many people.
