What is a quotation/section that you found meaningful/valuable, and why?
	The discussion surrounding how these studies or rites of passage make those that do not experience these traditions reflect was very interesting. The ways people seem to realize that these rites of passage are useful and necessary for help in tackling the larger world is very important. Another section was the section discussing how import ecology is to indigenous beliefs. This discussion revolving climate change and just an overall care for the world seems vital as we continue to orbit the sun on this floating rock in space that is our only home.

What is a good discussion question for this reading?
	Do you agree that other cultures or peoples should attempt to create rites of passage of their own? Do you think that is viable?
