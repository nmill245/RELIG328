*What is the reading about?
	This reading is a meta-analysis of works regarding ethical Indigenous studies worldwide. The analysis focuses upon the different methods utilized when attempting to have ethical research. It seems to be sparked by the First Peoples activism and the creation of an ethical guideline in Canada on how to conduct Indigenous studies. It focuses on 5 overall pratices that seem to be put in place when doing ethical Indigenous research. These methods are: Community-Based Participatory Research, Western Methods with an Indigenous Context, Storytelling, General Indigenous Frameworks, and Culture-Specific Methods.

*How is the author supporting their argument?
	The authors supports their work by bringing in a multitiude of other works when giving commentary. When making claims on focusing upon CBPR for example, they bring it key documents outlining why that should be used and also bringing in documents where the method has been used. From there they are pointing the reader in the proper direction to understand further on specific topics. They also note the limitations that their research may have, not treating their research as the last in a long line of knowledge, but just another piece.

*What are 2+ key terms & their definitions?
	- Community-Based Participatory Research(CBPR)
		CBPR is a collaborative research technique that focuses on the needs of the community with a goal of collaboration, research equality, and community control.
	- Indigenous research
		Overall the piece is attempting to define this word in a way, and it seems the definition should be too broad rather than too narrow. The definition that best fits to me is research focused upon the Indigenous community first and the lust for truth second, how that is implemented is what the paper describes but overall it is community / people first and knowledge second

What is a quotation/section that you found meaningful/valuable, and why?

What is a good discussion question for this reading?
What other steps, if any, should be taking place in relation to creating more ethical research to Indigenous populations specifically?

How does some element from this chapter connect with a previous reading/discussion?
This connects deeply with the first reading, as the first reading noted how one much decolonize their view of religion when studying the history of religion broadly. This article in tandem, focuses on how a Western approach to Indigenous research in general needs to be decolonized.
