What is a good discussion question for this reading?
    It seems Native American practices are focused on subsistence and foods that can be created near where they live, how do you think globalization / importation of goods affects this connection and belief structure, if at all?

How does some element from this chapter connect with a previous reading/discussion?
    This chapter connects to ideas of decolonization as proposed by Yang and Tuck. This is because the US government, the settler colonial apperatus, has attempted to eradicate Native Americans connections to food, but by virtue of rebuking that, they are partaking in decolonization. In order to Native American communities to thrive with their connection to their food sources and such, there seems to need to be a total reshaping of how we view the earth and the land. There may be ways to do it without decolonization, but it is a step in that direction.
